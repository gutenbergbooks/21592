<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The most usual drink in the United States, is whiskey; other
spirituous liquors, such as peach and apple brandy, are
only secondary, and from their high price and their scarcity,
they are not sufficient for the wants of an already immense and
increasing population. As to wine, in spite of all the efforts and
repeated trials made to propagate the grape-vine, there is
as yet no hopes, that it may in time become the principal drink
of the Americans.</p>

<p>To turn our enquiries towards the means of bringing the art
of making whiskey to greater perfection, is therefore, to contribute
to the welfare of the United States, and even to the
health of the Americans, and to the prosperity of the distiller,
as I will prove in the sequel.</p>

<p>The arts and sciences have made great progress; my aim is
to diffuse new light on every thing that relates to the formation
of spirituous liquors that may be obtained from grains. Most
arts and trades are practised without principles, perhaps from
the want of the means of information. For the advantage of
the distillers of whiskey, I will collect and offer them the means of
obtaining from a given quantity of grain, the greatest possible
quantity of spirit, purer and cheaper than by the usual methods.
I shall then proceed to indicate the methods of converting
whiskey into gin, according to the process of the Holland Distillers,
without heightening its price.</p>

<p>If the principles hereafter developed are followed, the trade
of distiller will acquire great advantages, that will spread their
influence on agriculture, and consequently on commerce in
general.</p>

OF<br />
MAKING WHISKEY, &amp;c.</h1>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>OF SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS, OR SPIRITS.</h3>


<p><big>Spirituous liquors</big> are the produce of vinous
ones, obtained by the distillation of these last. The
art of making wine is of the remotest antiquity, since
it is attributed to Noah; but that of distilling it, so as
to extract its most spirituous part, dates only from the
year 1300. Arnand de Villeneuve was the inventor
of it, and the produce of his Still appeared so marvellous,
that it was named Aqua-Vit&aelig;, or <i>Water of
Life</i>, and has ever since continued under that denomination
in France; Voltaire and reason say that it might,
with far more propriety, be called <i>Aqua-Mortis</i>, or
Water of Death.</p>

<p>This liquor, called in English, <i>Brandy</i>, received
from the learned the name of <i>Spirit of Wine</i>; time
improved the art of making it still stronger by concentration,
and in that state it is called <i>Alcohol</i>.</p>

<p>All spirit is the distilled result of a wine, either of
grapes, other fruits, or grains; it is therefore necessary
to have either wine, or any vinous liquor, in order to
obtain spirits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>OF THE FORMATION OF VINOUS LIQUORS WITH GRAINS, IN
ORDER TO MAKE SPIRITS.</h3>


<p><big>The</big> art of extracting wine from the juice of the grape,
not being the object of this book, I shall confine myself
to what is necessary and useful to the distillers of whiskey;
it is therefore of the vinous liquor extracted from
grains, that I am going to speak.</p>

<p>The formation of that kind of liquor is founded upon
a faculty peculiar to grains, which the learned chymist,
Fourcroy, has called <i>saccharine fermentation</i>. Sugar
itself does not exist in gramineous substances; they
only contain its elements, or first principles, which produce
it. The saccharine fermentation converts those
elements into sugar, or at least into a saccharine matter;
and when this is developed, it yields the eminent
principle of fermentation, without which there exists no
wine, and consequently no spirit.</p>

<p>Grains yield two kinds of vinous liquors, of which
the distiller makes spirit, and the brewer a sort of wine,
called <i>beer</i>. From a comparison of the processes employed
to obtain these two results, it will be found that
the brewer's art has attained a higher degree of perfection
than that of the distiller. They both have for their
object to obtain a vinous liquor; but that of the brewer
is, in reality, a sort of wine to which he gives, at pleasure,
different degrees of strength; while that of the
distiller is scarcely vinous, and cannot be made richer.
I will give a succinct exposition of their two processes
in order that they may be compared.</p>


<h3>OF THE ART OF BREWING.</h3>

<p>The art of brewing consists:</p>

<p>1st. In the sprouting of a proportion of grain, chiefly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
barley. This operation converts into a saccharine
matter, the elements of that same substance already existing
in grains.</p>

<p>2dly. In preparing the <i>wort</i>. For that operation,
the grain, having been previously ground, is put into a
vat, which is half filled up with water; the rest is filled
up at three different times with hot water&mdash;the first at
100&deg;, the second at 150&deg;, and the third at 212&deg;, which
is boiling water. The mixture is strongly stirred each
time that it is immersed. By this infusion, the water
lays hold of the sweet principles contained in the grain.</p>

<p>3dly. The wort thus prepared, the liquor is filtrated,
in order to separate it from the grain, and then boiled
until reduced to one half, in order to concentrate it to
the degree of strength desired. In that state, 40 gallons
of wort contain the saccharine principles of 200 wt.
of grain.</p>

<p>4thly. The wort, thus concentrated, is drawn off in
barrels, which are kept in a temperature of 80&deg; or 85&deg;.
The yeast is thrown into it to establish the fermentation,
and in a short time beer is made, more or less
strong, according to the degree of concentration, and
more or less bitter, according to the greater or lesser
proportion of hops put into it.</p>

<p>Such are, in a concise view, the proceedings of the
brewer. Let us proceed to those of the distiller of
whiskey.</p>


<h3>OF THE DISTILLER OF WHISKEY.</h3>

<p>Whiskey is made either with rye, barley, or Indian
corn. One, or all those kinds of grains is used, as
they are more or less abundant in the country. I do
not know how far they are mixed in Kentucky; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Indian corn is here in general the basis of whiskey, and
more often employed alone.</p>

<p>I have ascertained, in the different distilleries which
I have visited in the United States&mdash;</p>

<p>1stly. That, in general, the grain is not sprouted.
I have, however, seen some distillers who put 10lbs.
of malt into a hogshead of fermentation containing 100
gallons, which reduces it to almost nothing.</p>

<p>2dly. That they put two bushels of ground grain into
a hogshead of fermentation containing 100 gallons,
filled up with water.</p>

<p>3dly. They had a ferment to determine the fermentation,
which, when finished, yields two gallons of whiskey
per bushel of grain, and sometimes ten quarts, but
very seldom. I do not know whether those results are
exact; but, supposing them to be so, they must be subject
to great variations, according to the quality of the
grain, the season, the degree of heat, of the atmosphere,
and the manner of conducting the fermentation.
From my analysing the different sorts of grains, I know
that Indian corn must yield the most spirit.</p>

<p>From the above proportions, it results, that 100 gallons
of the vinous liquor of distillers yield only 4 gallons
of whiskey, and very seldom 5; that is, from a 25th
to a 20th. It is easy to conceive how weak a mixture,
25 parts of water to one of whiskey, must be; thus
the produce of the first distillation is only at 11&deg; or 12&deg;
by the areometer, the water being at 10&deg;. It is only
by several subsequent distillations, that the necessary
concentration is obtained, to make saleable whiskey.
These repeated operations are attended with an increased
expense of fuel, labor, and time.</p>

<p>Such are the usual methods of the whiskey distillers.
Before we compare them with those of the brewer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
let us examine the nature of fermentation, and what are
the elements the most proper to form a good vinous liquor:
thence we shall judge with certainty, of those
two ways of operating.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>OF FERMENTATION.</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><p>"<big>Fermentation</big> is a spontaneous and intestine
motion, which takes place amongst the principles
of organic substance deprived of life, the maximum
of which always tends to change the nature of
bodies, and gives rise to the formation of new productions."</p>

<p><i>Bouillon la Grange.&mdash;Manual of a Course of Chymistry.</i></p></div>

<p>Fermentation has long since been divided into <i>spirituous</i>,
<i>acid</i>, and <i>putrid</i>.</p>

<p>It is only since the revival or new epoch of chymistry,
that the learned have been occupied in researches
on fermentation. I was the first who gave a new hint
on this important part of natural philosophy, in 1785.
It was then held as certain, that the saccharine substance
was the principle of spirituous fermentation. A series of
experiments enabled me to demonstrate the contrary,
for I obtained a well crystallized sugar by the fermentation
of a substance which produces none by any other
means.</p>

<p>In September, 1785, I read a memoir to the Academy
of Sciences, at Paris. In that memoir I developed
my theory. That learned body nominated four
commissioners, for the purpose of examining my operations,
and sanctioned my discovery by a report, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
which it was acknowledged that I had discovered a
new truth, and ordered the insertion of my memoir in
the collection of those of the Foreign Associates. I attributed
the principle of the spirituous fermentation to
the mucilaginous substance. This has been since demonstrated,
by attentively observing that it always begins
with a motion of acid fermentation, which is produced
by the mucilaginous substance. The European
chymists have since reasoned upon fermentation; each
of them has produced a new system; none have been
able to bring it to a regular demonstration; and the
learned Gay Lussac has said, that fermentation is one
of the most mysterious operations of chymistry. Be
that as it may, there are facts that are ascertained: let
us endeavor to investigate them, that we may derive
from them all the information which is necessary to us.</p>

<p>It is incontestable that spirits are produced by the
saccharine substance. Grains, however, supply it, although
they are not sensibly sweet. This has made
me suspect that the fermentation is at first saccharine,
which produces the sweet substance that is necessary
for the formation of spirit. It is thus that, by a series
of internal motions, the fermentation causes the formation
of the spirit to be preceded by a slight production
of acid; that it transforms the vinous liquor into vinegar,
which the same fermentation changes in time into
an animal substance, destroyed in its turn by the putrid
fermentation. Such are the progressive changes
operated by this all-disorganizing phenomenon, and
the unerring march of nature to bring back all substances
to their respective elements.</p>

<p>The necessary conditions for the formation of vinous
fermentation, are&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<ul>
<li>1st. The presence of the saccharine substance.</li>
<li>2dly. That of a vegeto-animal substance, commonly
called ferment, and soluble in water.</li>

<li>3dly. A certain quantity of water.</li>

<li>4thly. A temperature of 70&deg; to 75&deg;.</li>

<li>5thly. A sufficient mass.</li>
</ul>

<p>When these are obtained, in a short time the liquor
becomes turbid; it bubbles, from the disengaging of
the carbonic acid gaz, and the heat increases considerably.
After some days, these impetuous motions subside;
the fermentation ceases by degrees; the liquor
clears up; then it emits a vinous smell and taste. As
soon as it ferments no more, it must be distilled. However,
some distillers have asserted that a greater quantity
of spirit is obtained when the liquor has acquired
a certain degree of acidity. Others are of opinion that
it must be distilled as soon as it is calm. I am of this
opinion, because the acid can only be formed at the expense
of a little of the spirit, which is one of the principles
of the acetous acid. Besides, the longer the liquor
remains in a mass, the more spirit is wasted by
evaporation.</p>

<p>The produce will be 57lbs. of dry alcohol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
TR: Poor quality made it difficult to verify the above numbers
and so noted with an asterisk</div>
<p>A vessel containing one ounce of water, filled up
with this alcohol, weighs only 16dwts. and 16grs.
From this report, it appears that the specific weight of
the alcohol is, to the weight of the water, as 20 to 24;
that is, that water weighs 1/5 more than alcohol. If the
57lbs. thus obtained were only water, it would only
represent 7-1/8* gallons; but being alcohol, it weighs 1/6* less,
and consequently gives 7-1/8 gallons more, the sixth of
this quantity, (to wit:) 1-1/6* gallons, which, added to 7-1/8*,
make 8-7/24 gallons.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>But 1 gallon of dry alcohol, extended in 2 gallons
of water, gives 3 gallons of liquor at 19&deg;, which is
called Holland, or first proof; a produce surpassing
all what has been hitherto known to the distillers. I
will prove it by an example: 1 gallon of molasses
yields only 1 gallon of rum, at 19&deg;, to the rum distiller;
still, molasses is a true sirup, composed of 8lbs.
of sugar, or sweet matter, more fermentable than sugar.
12&frac12; gallons of molasses, representing 100lbs. of
dry sweet matter yield consequently 12&frac12; galls. of rum,
Holland proof, which is only half the produce obtained
by Lavoisier; an immense difference capable of exciting
the emulation of all distillers, as it proves the
imperfection of the art.</p>

<p>What are the causes of such a dissimilarity of product?
We must seek for them.</p>

<p>1st. In the difference of the strength of the vinous
liquor. Lavoisier employed only 4 parts of water to 1
part of dry sugar. The rum distiller usually puts 10
gallons of molasses to 90 gallons of water, or the residue
of the preceding distillations.</p>

<p>
10 galls. molasses contain</p>
<p>
80 lbs. of sweet matter.<br />
</p>

<p>90 gallons of water weigh 720lbs.; therefore the proportion
is, one part of sweet matter to 9 parts of water&mdash;whilst
that indicated by Lavoisier is only 4 parts of
water to 1 part of sugar.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[a]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious how much richer this last must be, and
that the fermentation thus produced has an energy far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
superior to the other. Thence results a rapid production
of spirit, operated in a short time; whilst that of
the rum distiller languishes more or less, and a slow
fermentation wastes part of the spirit which it produces,
even as it is forming.</p>

<p>2dly. Bodies evaporate in proportion to the extent
of their surface. One hogshead of 100 gallons, should
contain, according to Lavoisier's composition, the elements
of 50 gallons of spirit, at 19&deg;; whilst that of the
rum distiller contains only 12. Now, as every fermentable
liquor requires open vessels, the hogshead of
the rum distiller loses as much spirit as that of Lavoisier:
hence it is plain how far the above proportion
operates to the disadvantage of the fermer.</p>

<p>3dly. Another source of loss arises in the distilling
vessels themselves. Nothing is more imperfect than
the stills of a whiskey distillery. Lavoisier's were so
perfect, that he made the analysis and the synthesis in
the most delicate operations. <a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> The vessels of the
whiskey distillers, far from being hermetically closed,
allow the spirit to evaporate through every joint. And
this is not all: corroded by the acetous acid, they are
full of small holes, particularly in the cap, where all
the vapors collect themselves, as in a reservoir. It is
easy to conceive with what rapidity they escape, which
occasions a considerable waste of liquor. In proof of
the truth of this observation, we may refer to the smell
of whiskey, so strongly perceivable on the roads leading
to a distillery, and preceeding from no other cause
than that liquor wasting out of bad vessels, to the great
loss of the distiller.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>4thly. A fourth cause of loss arises from the worm
of the still. However careful in keeping the surrounding
water cool, there is always one portion of vapor
not condensed. This is made more sensible in the
winter, when the cold of the atmosphere makes every
vapor visible; upon examination, it will be seen that
the running stream of liquor is surrounded with it. In
my description of my apparatus, I give the means of
obviating that evil.</p>

<p>To these several causes, may we not add another?
May not the production of spirit be in a ratio to the
richness of the fermenting liquor? It is certain, that in
every spirituous fermentation there is a portion of the
sweet matter which remains undecomposed and in its
original state. Lavoisier found that it was 4.940; that
is, nearly 5 parts in 100. It may possibly be the same
in a weaker liquor; which would increase the loss, in
the inverse ratio of the density of the liquor. Such are
the causes to which I attribute the great superiority of
Lavoisier's products; and from those observations I
thought I could establish the fabrication of whiskey
upon new principles.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A COMPARISON OF THE PROCESSES OF THE BREWER WITH
THOSE OF THE WHISKEY DISTILLER.</span></h3>


<p><big>From</big> the experiments of one of the most learned
chymists of Europe, it has been demonstrated, that the
proportions the most advantageous to the formation of
a good vinous liquor, are, one part of dry sweet substance
to four parts of water; that is, that the sugar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
must form one fifth of the whole. We have, moreover,
seen that 100lbs. of dry sweet matter gave 25 gallons of
spirit 19&deg;, which comes to 4lbs. of sugar per gallon.</p>

<p>We shall make use of that scale in comparing the
processes of the brewer with those of the whiskey distiller.</p>

<p>Supposing the bushel of grain to weigh 50 pounds,
and that it gives 2 gallons of whiskey at 19&deg;, each of
which gallons is the product of 4lbs. of sugar; then
the strong beer which contains in 40 gallons the
sweet matter of 200lbs. of grain, contains the elements
of 8 gallons of spirit, or 32lbs. of dry sweet substance;
and as the 40 gallons of this beer weigh 320lbs. the
32lbs. of sugar form only one-tenth of it, which is one
half of Lavoisier's proportions.</p>

<p>Those of the distiller of whiskey are 100lbs. of grain
to 100 gallons of water, or thereabouts: 100lbs. of grain
contain only 16lbs. of dry sweet matter: therefore, as
the 100 gallons of vinous liquor weigh 800lbs. the 16lbs.
of sugar form only its fiftieth part.</p>

<p>Thence is seen how inferior the proportions of the
whiskey distiller are to those of the brewer, and how
far they are from good theory. But the brewer aims
only at producing a sort of wine, and succeeds; while,
the distiller wants to make spirit, and only obtains it
in the manner the most expensive, and opposed to his
own interest.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>DEFECTS IN THE USUAL METHOD OF MAKING WHISKEY.</h3>


<p>1st. <big>The</big> most hurtful of all for the interests of the
distillers, is undoubtedly the weakness of the vinous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
liquor. We have seen that the proportion of spirit is
in a ratio to the richness of the fermenting liquor; that
Lavoisier, by putting one-fifth of the mass of dry sugar,
obtained twice as much spirit as the rum distiller, who
puts in the same quantity, but drowns it in water.
From those principles, which are not contested, the distiller,
whose vinous liquor contains only one-fiftieth
part of sweet matter, obtains the less spirit, and loses
as much of it as he gets.</p>

<p>2dly. Another defect is joined to this: bodies are
dissolved by reason of their affinity with the dissolving
principle; the mucilaginous substance is as soluble in
water as the saccharine substance. A mass of 100 gallons
of water having only 16lbs. of sugar to dissolve,
exerts it's dissolving powers upon the mucilaginous part
which abounds in grains, and dissolves a great quantity
of it. There results from that mixture, a fermentation
partaking of the spirit and the acid, and if the
temperature of the atmosphere is moderate, the acid
invades the spirit, which is one of its principles: nothing
remains but vinegar, and the hopes of the distiller
are deceived.</p>

<p>Some distillers have been induced, by the smallness
of their products, to put in their stills, not only the fluid
of the liquor, but the flour itself. Hence result two
important defects. 1st. The solid matter precipitates
itself to the bottom of the still, where it burns, and gives
a very bad taste to the whiskey. In order to remedy
this inconvenience, it has been imagined to stir the flour
incessantly, by means of a chain dragged at the bottom
of the still, and put in motion by an axis passing through
the cap, and turned by a workman until the ebullition
takes place. This axis, however well fitted to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
aperture, leaves an empty space, and gives an issue to
the spirituous vapors, which escaping with rapidity,
thereby occasion a considerable loss of spirit.</p>

<p>3dly. The presence of the grain in the still, converted
into meal, is not otherwise indifferent. It contains
a kind of essential oil, more or less disagreeable, according
to its nature; which distils with the spirit. That
of Indian corn, in particular, is more noxious than that
of any other grain; and it is the presence of meal in
the stills, which causes the liquors obtained from grains
to be so much inferior to that of fruits.</p>

<p>4thly. There is a fourth defect, at which humanity
shudders, and which the laws ought to repress. Vinous
liquors are more or less accompanied with acetone acid,
or vinegar; but those proceeding from grain contain still
more of this acid. The stills are generally made of
naked copper; the acid works upon that metal, and
forms with it the <i>acetate of copper</i>, or verdigrise, part
of which passes with the whiskey. There is no distiller,
who, with a little attention, has not observed it.
I have always discovered it in my numerous rectifications,
and at the end of the operation, when nothing
more comes from the still but what is called the sweet
oil of wine. An incontestable proof of this truth is,
that as the stills of the distillers are of a green color in
their interior part; that they are corroded with the acid,
and pierced with numberless little holes, which render
them unfit for use in a very short time. It is easy to
conceive how hurtful must be the presence of verdigrise
to those who make use of whiskey as a constant
drink: even those who use it soberly, swallow a slow
poison, destructive of their stomach; while to those
who abuse it, it produces a rapid death, which would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
still be the consequence of abuse, if the liquor was pure,
but is doubly accelerated by the poison contained in
the whiskey. It is easy to remedy so terrible an evil.
The acetous acid has no action upon tin. By tinning
the stills, the purity of the liquor will be augmented,
and the distilling vessels, already so expensive, will
be longer preserved. This operation must be renewed
every year. The worms must likewise be tinned, if
they are copper; but they are better of tin, or of the
purest pewter.</p>

<p>Such are the defects of the present method of distilling
whiskey. Having exposed them, I must present
the means of bringing to perfection the fabrication of a
liquor of such general use.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS
TO MAKE WHISKEY.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">
TR: The next 2 paragraphs were cut short, noted
with [*]</div>

<p><big>As</big> it is demonstrated that the spirit is the more abundant
in proportion to the richness of the vinous liquor,*
it is therefore necessary to enrich that of the distillery*
which is so deficient in that respect. An exposition of*
my processes will point out the means I employ to attain*
that end. A large whiskey distillery should be*
able to make 100 gallons per day, or three barrels*
making altogether that quantity.</p>

<p>One gallon of spirit being the produce of 4 pounds*
of dry saccharine matter, we must therefore have 400
pounds of this substance for the 100 gallons we wish
to obtain.</p>

<p>If 1 bushel of grain gives 2 gallons of whiskey, there
must be 50 to obtain a daily result of 100 gallons. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
take Indian corn as the basis of the fabrication, as that
of all the grains which yields the most. For, from my
method, whatever grain is employed, the spirit is
equally pure.</p>

<p>I divide the still house into three different rooms,
to wit:</p>

<p>One for Infusion;</p>
<p>One for Fermentation;</p>
<p>One for Distillation.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE ROOM OF INFUSION.</h3>


<p><big>It</big> is here that the liquor destined to make whiskey,
should be prepared, and made rich enough to procure a
good fermentation. To this effect, there must be a mill
with a vertical stone, moved by a horse, or any other
means of motion. Those mills are too well known for
me to describe them more amply. The corn must be
coarsely ground, so as scarcely to be broke into three
or four pieces: consequently the stone must not be too
heavy, for, at all events, the grain had better be too
coarse than too fine. That mill should be placed in the
infusion room, so as not to keep it dirty, nor to be too
much in the way. It must grind, or rather break, 50
bushels per day.</p>

<p>There must be a square kettle, 4 feet broad, 5 feet
long, 1 foot deep. The kettle must be made in sheets
of copper, one line thick, at least: the bottom, although
flat, should have a slight swell inside, so as to avoid
the expansion of the metal outside, from the action of
the fire. This kettle must be placed upon a brick fur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>nace,
so that the longest parts should bear forwards, and
the other against the chimney, from which it must be
separated by a brick wall eight or nine inches. The
sides, around which there must be a space to walk
freely, should be supported by a wall 1&frac12; feet deep;
the fore part upon such a wall, in the middle of which
is an iron door, fifteen inches square, in an iron frame,
through which the fuel is introduced.</p>

<p>The kettle is mounted upon the furnace, so as to bear
upon the four walls about 4 inches, and rests upon a
bed of clay, which must leave no passage to the action
of the fire; it is lined externally with bricks, and must
have a pipe on one of its sides, to draw off the liquor.</p>

<p>Under the kettle, 15 inches from the bottom, is a flue
for the heat, running through all its length. It is 2&frac12;
feet wide at bottom, extending like a fan at the top,
about 6 inches on each side, so that the flame may circulate
in all the breadth of the kettle.</p>

<p>On the fore part of this flue, facing the door, is a
hearth, occupying all its breadth, and 2 feet long. The
rest of the flue is paved with bricks, and rises insensibly
4 inches towards the chimney, in which it opens by
two holes, 1&frac12; inches wide, 8 or 9 inches high.</p>

<p>Immediately under the hearth, is a mash hole 4 feet
deep, occupying all its capacity, and projecting 2 feet
forward. This opening is necessary to keep up a free
circulation of air, and to take up the ashes. It should
be covered with strong boards, not to hinder the service
of the kettle. The hearth is made with an iron grate,
more or less close, according to the nature of the fuel;
if for wood, the bars must be about two inches apart;
if for coals, half an inch is sufficient. The furnace must
be built with care. The parts most exposed to the ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>tion
of the fire must be built with soft bricks and potters'
clay: soap stone would be preferable, if easy to
procure. The brick separating the kettle and chimney,
must be supported with flat bars of iron, as well
as the part over the door.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>USE OF THE KETTLE.</h3>


<p><big>The</big> kettle is destined to make the infusion of the
grain, and boil it so as to convert it into wort. By that
operation I make the liquor richer, which I intend for
fermentation, and bring it to divers degrees of strength.</p>

<p>I put into the kettle 100 gallons of water, and 4
bushels of corn, broken, as I said before, at the mill.
I light a small fire, which I increase gradually, until
the water begins to boil; during that time, the grain is
stirred with a paddle. As soon as the ebullition is established,
the grain is taken up with a large skimmer,
and put to drain into a large basket hanging over the
kettle; and when the grain has been totally taken up,
the fire is increased so as to bring the water to boil
again, until reduced to two-fifths, which degree of concentration
is not rigorous, and the distiller may augment
it as his experience shall direct. When thus concentrated,
the liquor is drawn off through the pipe, and
received into a tub or vat containing 130 or 140 galls.</p>

<p>100 gallons more of water are put into the kettle,
with 4 bushels of corn; the fire conducted slowly, as
before, until the degree of ebullition; the corn is taken
off, and the liquor concentrated in the same proportions;
then drawn off as above, in the same tub.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The same operation is repeated for the third time;
the three united liquors are slightly stirred, and, still
warm, transported into one of the hogsheads of fermentation,
which it nearly fills up.</p>

<p>As there must be four of these hogsheads filled up
daily, the work at the kettle must be kept going on,
without interruption, until that quantity is obtained,
which may be done in about twelve hours. The grain
which has been drained is carried to dry, either in the
open air, or in a granary, and spread thin. When dry,
it is excellent food for cattle, and highly preferable to
the acid and fermented mash, usually used by distillers
to feed cattle and hogs: they eat the corn dried in the
above manner as if it had lost nothing of its primitive
qualities and flavor.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE ROOM FOR FERMENTATION.</h3>


<p><big>The</big> room destined to the fermentation must be close,
lighted by two or three windows, and large enough to
contain a number of hogsheads sufficient for the distillery.
It may be determined by the number of days
necessary for the fermentation; 30 or 40 hogsheads
may suffice, each of 120 or 130 gallons.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room must be a stove, large
enough to keep up a heat of 75&deg; to 80&deg;, even in winter.
A thermometer placed at one end of the room, serves
to regulate the heat.</p>

<p>As soon as the liquor is in the hogshead, the yeast,
or fermenting principle, is put into it, stirred for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
moments, and then left to itself. A liquor as rich as
the above described ferments with force, and runs with
rapidity through all the periods of fermentation. It is
fit to distil as soon as that tumultuous state has subsided
and the liquor is calm.</p>

<p>The essential character of the spirituous fermentation,
is to exhale the carbonic acid gaz in great quantity.
This gaz is mortal to mankind, and to all the
living creation. Thirty hogsheads of fermenting liquor
producing a great deal of this gaz, the room should be
purified of it by opening two opposite windows several
times a day. This is the more essential, as the pure
air, or <i>oxigen</i>, contributes to the formation of the spirit,
of which it is one of the constituting principles.
A short time, however, suffices to renew the air of the
room.</p>

<p>It is useless to remark, that the hogsheads must be
open at one end, and rest upon pieces of wood elevating
them some inches from the ground. They must remain
uncovered during the fermentation; and afterwards be
covered with a flying lid, when the liquor is calm.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>OF THE ROOM FOR DISTILLATION.</h3>


<p><big>We</big> have hitherto considered the liquor as containing
only principles upon which the air has no action, and
from which it can only extract some watery vapors;
and, in fact, all those principles contained in the liquor
are fixed. The action of the fire may concentrate, but
not volatilize them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The liquor is now changed by the fermentation; it
contains no longer the same principles, but has acquired
those which it had not, which are volatile, and evaporate
easily. They must therefore be managed carefully,
in order not to lose the fruits of an already tedious
labor. The spirit already created in the fermented
liquor, must be collected by the distillation; but
in transporting it to the still, the action of the external
air must be carefully avoided, as it would cause the
evaporation of some of the spirit. A pump to empty
the hogsheads, and covered pipes to conduct the liquor
into the still, is what has been found to answer that
purpose. A good distilling apparatus is undoubtedly
the most important part of a distillery. It must unite
solidity, perfection in its joints, economy of fuel, rapidity
of distillation, to the faculty of concentrating the
spirit. Such are the ends I have proposed to myself
in the following apparatus.</p>

<p>The usual shape of stills is defective; they are too
deep, and do not present enough of surface for their contents.
They require a violent fire to bring them to ebullition;
the liquor at bottom burns before it is warm at
the top.</p>

<p>My still is made upon different principles, and composed
of two pieces, viz. the kettle, and its lid. The
kettle, forming a long square, is like the kettle of infusion,
already described, and only differs from it in being
one foot deeper. The lid is in shape like an ancient
bed tester; that is to say, its four corners rise into a
sharp angle, and come to support a circle 16 inches
diameter, bearing a vertical collar of about two inches.
This collar comes to the middle of the kettle, and is
elevated about 4 feet from the bottom. The lid is fas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>tened
to the kettle. The collar receives a pewter cap,
to which is joined a pipe of the same metal, the diameter
of which decreases progressively to a little less
than 3 inches: this pipe, the direction of which is almost
horizontal, is 5 feet long.</p>

<p>My still, thus constructed, is established upon a furnace
like that of the infusion room. I observe that the
side walls are only raised to the half of the height of
the kettle. A vertical pipe is placed on the side opposite
to the pewter one, and serves to fill up the still:
it is almost at the height of the fastening of the lid, but
a little above. On the same side, on a level with the
bottom, is a pipe of discharge, passing across the furnace:
this pipe must project enough to help to receive
or to direct the fluid residue of the distillation; its diameter
must be such as to operate a prompt discharge
of the still.</p>


<h3>OF THE URNS.</h3>

<p>These are copper vessels, thus called from their resembling
those funeral vases of the ancients. Mine have
a bottom of about 18 inches diameter; they are two
feet high, have a bulge of 6 inches near the top, and
then draw in to form an overture of about 8 inches.</p>

<p>On one side, towards the top, there is a copper pipe
2 inches diameter, projecting externally 2 or 3 inches,
and bent in an elbow: it enters the internal part of the
urn, and descends towards the bottom, without touching
it; there it is only a slight curve, and remains open.</p>

<p>The external part of that pipe is fitted to receive the
pewter pipe of the still; they are made so as to enter
into one another, and must fit exactly. The round
opening at the top of the urn receives a cap with a pewter
pipe, made like that of the still. It is likewise five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
feet long, and its size in proportion to the opening: this
goes and joins itself to the second urn, as the still does
to the first. The pipe of this second goes to a third,
and the pipe of this last to the worm. The three urns
bear each a small pipe of discharge towards the bottom.</p>

<p>This apparatus must be made with the greatest care.
Neither the joints, the different pipes of communication,
nor the nailings, must leave the smallest passage to the
vapors. The workman must pay the greatest attention
to his work, and the distiller must lute exactly all
the parts of the apparatus that are susceptible of it: he
must be the more careful as to luting it, as this operation
is only performed once a week, when the apparatus
is cleaned. At the moment of the distillation, the master
or his foreman must carefully observe whether there
is any waste of vapors, and remedy it instantly. The
still and urns ought to be well tinned.</p>

<h3>EFFECTS OF THIS APPARATUS.</h3>


<p><big>Although</big> the still might contain 400 gallons,
there must be only 200 gallons put into it: the rest remaining
empty, the vapors develops themselves, and
rise. In that state, the vinous liquor is about one foot
deep, on a surface of 20 feet square: hence two advantages&mdash;the
first, that being so shallow, it requires but
little fuel to boil; the second, that the extent of surface
gives rise to a rapid evaporation, which accelerates the
work. This acceleration is such, that six distillations
might be obtained in one day. The spirit contained in
the vinous liquor rises in vapors to the lid of the still,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
there find the cap and its pipe, through which they escape
into the first urn, by the side pipe above described,
which conducts them to the bottom, where they are
condensed immediately.</p>

<p>But the vapors, continuing to come into the urn, heat
it progressively: the spirituous liquor that it contains
rises anew into vapors, escapes through the cap and
pipe, and arrives into the second urn, where it is condensed
as in the first. Here again, the same cause
produces the same effect: the affluence of the heat
drawn with the vapors, carries them successively into
the third urn, and from thence into the worm, which
condenses them by the effects of the cold water in which
it is immersed.</p>

<p>The urns, receiving no other heat than that which
the vapors coming out of the still can transmit to them,
raise the spirit; the water, at least the greatest part of
it, remains at the bottom: hence, what runs from the
worm is alcohol; that is, spirit at 35&deg;. It is easily understood
how the vapors coming out of the still are
rectified in the urns, and that three successive rectifications
bring the spirit to a high degree of concentration:
it gets lower only when the vinous liquor draws towards
the end of the distillation. As soon as it yields no more
spirit, the fire is stopped, and the still is emptied in
order to fill it up again, to begin a new distillation.</p>

<p>Each time that the vinous liquor is renewed in the
still, the water contained in the urns must be emptied,
through the pipes of discharge at the bottom.</p>

<p>Metals are conductors of the <i>caloric</i>. The heat accumulated
in the still, rises to the cap, from whence it
runs into the urns: with this difference&mdash;that the pewter,
of which the cap and pipes are made, transmits less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
caloric than copper, because it is less dense: and that
bodies are only heated in reason of their density.</p>

<p>However, a great deal of heat is still communicated
to the worm, and heats the water in which it is immersed.
I diminish this inconvenience by putting a
wooden pipe between the worm and the pipe of the
third urn. Wood being a bad conductor of caloric,
produces a <i>solution of continuity</i>, or interruption between
the metals. The wood of this pipe must be soft
and porous, and not apt to work by the action of the
fire: however, to avoid its splitting, I wrap it up in two
or three doubles of good paper, well pasted, and dried
slowly. This pipe is one foot long, and hollowed in
its length, so as to receive the pewter pipe of the third
urn at one end, and to enter the worm at the other;
thereby the worm is not as hot, since it only receives
the heat of the vapors which it condenses.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these precautions, it heats the
water in which it is immersed after a length of time;
and whatever care may be taken to renew it, all the
vapors are not condensed, and this occasions a loss of
spirit. I obviate this accident, by adding a second
worm to the first: they communicate by means of a
wooden pipe like the above. The effect of this second
worm, rather smaller than the first, is such, that the
water in which it is plunged remains cold, while that
of the first must be renewed very often. By these means,
no portion of vapors escape condensation. The liquor
running from the worm is received into a small barrel,
care being taken that it may not lose by the contact of
the air producing evaporation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h3>OF FERMENTS.</h3>


<p><big>They</big> are of two kinds; the very putrescent bodies,
and those supplied by the <i>oxigen</i>. Animal substances
are of the first kind: <i>acids</i>, neutral salts, rancid oils,
and metallic <i>oxids</i>, are of the second.</p>

<p>Were I obliged to make use of a ferment of the first
class, I would choose the glutinous part of wheat flour.
This vegeto-animal substance is formed in the following
manner:&mdash;A certain quantity of flour is made into
a solid dough, with a little water. It is then taken into
the hands, and water slowly poured over it, while it is
kneaded again. The water runs white, because it carries
off the starchy part of the flour; it runs clear after
it is washed sufficiently. There remains in the hands
of the operator a dough, compact, solid, elastic, and
reduced to nearly the half of the flour employed. This
dough, a little diluted with water, and kept in the temperature
indicated for the room of fermentation, passes
to the putrid state, and contracts the smell of spoiled
meat. Four pounds of this dough per hogshead, seem
to me to be sufficient to establish a good fermentation.
A small quantity of good vinegar would answer the
same purpose, and is a ferment of the second class.</p>

<p>But are those means indispensable with my process?
I do not think so.</p>

<p>1st. The richness of my vinous liquor, and the degree
of heat to which I keep it, tend strongly to make
it ferment. In fact, the infusion of the grain, by taking
from it its saccharine part, takes likewise part of its
mucilaginous substance, which is the principle of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
spirituous fermentation, which it establishes whenever
it meets with the other substance.</p>

<p>2dly. The hogsheads themselves are soon impregnated
with a fermenting principle, and communicate it
to the liquor that is put into them.</p>

<p>3dly. The rum distiller employs advantageously the
residue of his preceding distillation, to give a fermentation
to his new molasses: this residue has within itself
enough of acidity for that purpose. Might not the
residue of the distillation of my vinous liquor have the
same acidity? It contains only the mucilaginous substance
already acidulated. Some gallons of that residue
to every hogshead, would, I think, be a very good
ferment.</p>

<p>Lastly. Here is another means which will certainly
succeed: it is to leave at the bottom of each hogshead
three or four inches of the vinous liquor, when transported
into the still for distilling. This rising, which
will rapidly turn sour, will form a ferment sufficient to
establish a good fermentation.</p>

<p>The intelligent manager of a distillery must conduct
the means I indicate, towards the end which he proposes
to himself, and must carefully avoid to employ as
ferments, those disgusting substances which cannot fail
to bring a discredit on the liquor in which they are
known to be employed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>OF THE AREOMETER, OR PROOF BOTTLE.</h3>


<p><big>This</big> instrument is indispensable to the distiller: it
ascertains the value of his spirits, since it shows the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
result of their different degrees of concentration. I will
give the theory of this useful instrument, as it may be
acceptable to those who do not know it.</p>

<p>Bodies sink in fluids, in a <i>compound ratio</i> to the volume
and the density of those fluids, which they displace.
It is from that law of nature, that a ship sinks
20 feet in fresh water, while it sinks only about 18 feet
in sea water, which has more density on account of the
salt dissolved therein.</p>

<p>The reverse of this effect takes place in fluids lighter
than water, as bodies floating in them sink the more, as
the liquor has less density. Upon those principles are
made two kinds of areometers&mdash;one for fluids denser
than water; the other for those that are lighter: the
first are called <i>salt proof</i>; the second <i>spirit proof</i>.
Distilled water is the basis of those two scales: it is
at the top for the <i>salt proof</i>, and at the bottom for the
<i>spirit proof</i>; because the first is ascending, and the
other descending; but by a useless singularity, the distilled
water has been graduated at 10&deg; for the spirit
proof bottle, and at 0 for the <i>salt proof</i>. We shall
only dwell upon the first, because it is the only one interesting
to the distiller.</p>

<p>Water being graduated at 10&deg; in the areometer, it
results from thence that the spirit going to 20&deg;, is in
reality only 10&deg; lighter than water; and the alcohol
<ins class= "corr"
title="gaaduated">graduated</ins>  at 35&deg;, is only 25&deg; above distilled water.</p>

<p>The areometer can only be just, when the atmosphere
is temperate; that is, at 55&deg; Fahrenheit, or 10&deg;
Reaumur. The variations in cold or heat influence liquors;
they acquire density in the cold, and lose it in
the heat: hence follows that the areometer does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
sink enough in the winter, and sinks too much in the
summer.</p>

<p>Naturalists have observed that variation, and regulated
it. They have ascertained that 1&deg; of heat above
temperate, according to the scale of Reaumur, sinks the
areometer 1/8 of a degree more; and that 1&deg; less of heat,
had the contrary effect: thus the heat being at 18&deg; of
Reaumur, the spirit marking 21&deg; by the areometer, is
really only at 20&deg;. The cold being at 8&deg; below temperate,
the spirit marking only 19&deg; by the areometer, is
in reality at 20&deg;. 2&frac14; of Fahrenheit corresponding to
1&deg; of Reaumur, occasion in like manner a variation of
1/8 of a degree: thus, the heat being at 78&frac12;&deg;, the spirit
thus marking 21&deg;, is only at 20; and the cold being
at 87&deg;, the spirit marking only 19&deg; by the areometer,
is in reality at 20&deg;.</p>

<p>It is easily conceived, that extreme cold or extreme
heat occasion important variations. For that reason,
there are in Europe inspectors, whose duty it is to weigh
spirits, particularly <i>brandy</i>: for that purpose they make
use of the areometer and the thermometer. An areometer,
to be good, must be proved with distilled water,
at the temperature of 55&deg;. Areometers, being made of
glass, are brittle, and must be used with great care.
This inconvenience might be remedied, by making them
of silver; I have seen several of this metal. A good
silversmith could easily make them; I invite those artists
to attend to that branch of business; it might become
valuable, as the distillers will be more enlightened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>ADVANTAGES OF MY METHOD.</h3>


<p><big>The</big> first of all, is derived from the composition of a
vinous liquor, richer, and more proper to raise a vigorous
fermentation, than that which is obtained by the
usual method. Now, as it is proved that the quantity
of spirit is in proportion to the richness of the fermenting
liquor, mine therefore yields a great deal more spirit
than any other.</p>

<p>2dly. We have seen that a heat of 75&deg; or 80&deg; must
be kept up in the fermenting room: this being summer
heat, proves that such a rich vinous liquor runs no risk
of passing to the acid state with as much rapidity as that
of the common distillers; and, consequently, that he who
will follow my method can work all the year round without
fear of losing the fruits of his labor, as it often happens&mdash;an
advantage precious for him who makes it his
sole business. The only change he has to make, is to
suppress the heat of the stove, when the temperature
of the atmosphere is sufficient to keep up a good fermentation
in the liquor.</p>

<p>As to my distilling apparatus, this is not a new idea.
I present it to the public under the sanction of experience.
I had it executed in Philadelphia eight years
ago, after having obtained a patent. It was made for
a rum distillery, where they still continue to use it. It
presents the greatest advantages.</p>

<p>The first is, that with a single fire, and a single workman,
I distil and rectify the spirit three times, and bring
it to the degree of alcohol; that is, to the greatest purity,
and almost to the highest degree of concentration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>2dly. It lowers the cost of transportation, by two-thirds;
because one gallon at 35&deg; represents three gallons
at the usual degree. The merchant, being arrived
at the place of his destination, has only to add 2 gallons
of water to 1 gallon of this alcohol, in order to have
3 gallons of whiskey; which is of a considerable advantage,
either for land or sea carriage.</p>

<p>3dly. As the price of spirits is, in trade, in proportion
to their degree of concentration, those made with
my apparatus being at a very high degree, need no
more rectifying, either for the retailer, the apothecary,
or the painter; and the considerable expenses of that
operation turn entirely to the profit of the distiller, as
they are totally suppressed. Distillers may hereafter
sell spirits of all degrees of concentration.</p>

<p>Such are the advantages of my processes. I offer
them the more willingly to the public, as they are founded
upon the most approved principles of natural philosophy:
by reflecting upon them, distillers will be
easily convinced of it.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>However perfect the description of a new thing may
be, our ideas of it are always defective, until we have
seen it put into practical use. Few men have the means
of establishing a distillery on a new plan, and even the
most enlightened may make notable errors. Few, besides,
are bold enough to undertake, at their own risks,
the trial of a new fabrication: they are afraid of losing,
and of being blamed for having too lightly yielded to
the persuasion of new projectors. Hence it follows
that a useful discovery falls into oblivion, instead of
doing any good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>But no discovery of general utility ought to experience
that fate in a republic. Government itself ought
to promote the first undertaking, or a certain number of
citizens ought to join in order to give it a start. It is
the more easy in this case, as my apparatus requires
very little expense.</p>

<p>If a distillery according to my directions, was established
in some of the principal towns of the state, my
method would then make rapid progress, and thus prove
the truth of the principle which I have advanced; and
the distillers, after having meditated upon my method
in this book, would come and satisfy themselves of its
goodness, by seeing it put into practice, and yielding
the most perfect results, with all the advantages for
trade that may be expected: hence would naturally
ensue the rapid increase of distillation, and consequently
that of agriculture and commerce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<a name="MAKING_GIN" id="MAKING_GIN"></a>
<h2>THE ART OF<br />
MAKING GIN,<br />
AFTER THE PROCESS OF THE<br />
HOLLAND DISTILLERS.<br />
</h2>


<p><big>Having</big> indicated the most proper means of obtaining
spirits, I will now offer to the public the manner of
making <i>Gin</i>, according to the methods used by the distillers
in Holland. It may be more properly joined to
the art of making whiskey, as it adds only to the price
of the liquor, that of the juniper berries, the product of
which will amply repay its cost. Many distillers in
the United States have tried to imitate the excellent liquor
coming from Holland, under the name <i>gin</i>. They
have imagined different methods of proceeding, and
have more or less attained their end. I have myself
tried it, and my method is consigned in a patent.</p>

<p>But those imitations are far from the degree of perfection
of the Holland gin: they want that unity of
taste, which is the result of a single creation; they are
visibly compounds, more or less well combined, and
not the result of a spontaneous production.</p>

<p>To this capital defect, which makes those imitations
so widely different from their original, is joined their
high price, which prevents its general consumption. In
fact, it is made at a considerable expense: the whiskey
must be purchased, rectified and distilled over again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
with the berries. These expenses are increased by the
waste of spirit occasioned by those reiterated distillations.
This brings the price of this false gin to three
times that of the whiskey: consequently the poorer sort
of people, whose number is always considerable, are
deprived of the benefits of a wholesome liquor, and restrained
to whiskey, which is commonly not so.</p>

<p>The methods used in Holland, have reduced gin to
the lowest price; that of the juniper berries being there
very trifling, and increasing but little the price of whiskey:
still that small addition is almost reduced to nothing,
as will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p>The United States are, in some parts, almost covered
with the tree called here <i>cedar</i>; which tree is no
other than the juniper, and grows almost every where,
and bears yearly a berry, which is in reality the juniper
berry. Some Hollanders knew it at Boston, collected
considerable quantities of it in Massachusetts,
and shipping it to some of the eastern harbors, sold it
as coming from Holland. I have seen some at Philadelphia
ten years ago, at the house of a Hollander, who
received it from Massachusetts in hogsheads of about
ten hundred weight, and sold as the produce of his own
country, what was really that of the United States.</p>

<p>I collected myself a great quantity of those berries,
at Norfolk, Va. by means of negroes, to whom I paid
one dollar per bushel of 40 lbs. being 2&frac12; cts. per pound.
Two years ago, it sold for 6 cents in Philadelphia, and
bore the same price at Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of cedar in Kentucky, and consequently
of berries. I have seen them at Blue Licks,
and they abound near the Kentucky river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Although an incredible number of those trees is cut
down daily, there is still a greater number standing, in
the United States; and millions of bushels of berries
are lost every year, while only skilful hands are wanted,
to make them useful to mankind. The juniper
berry has many medical properties: it is a delightful
aromatic, and contains an oil essential, and a sweet extract,
which by the fermentation yields a vinous liquor,
made into a sort of wine in some countries; that is
called wine for the poor: it strengthens the stomach,
when debilitated by bad food or too hard labor.</p>

<p>The Hollanders, who have long had the art of trading
upon every thing, have constantly turned even their
poverty to account. They have immense fabrications
of gin, and scarcely any juniper trees. They only collect
the berry in those countries where it is neglected as
useless, as in France and Tyrol, which produce a great
deal of it. The United States need have no recourse
to Europe, in order to get the juniper berries: they
have in abundance at home, what the Hollanders can
only procure with trouble and money. They can therefore
rival them with great advantage; but they must
follow the same methods employed in the Holland distilleries.</p>

<p>The juniper berry contains the sweet mucous extract,
in a great proportion: it has therefore the principle
necessary to the spirituous fermentation; and, indeed,
it ferments spontaneously. When fresh, and heaped
up, it acquires a degree of heat, but not enough to burn,
as I have ascertained: it is therefore safely transported
in hogsheads. From that facility of fermenting, it must
be considered as a good ferment, and as increasing the
quantity of spirit, when joined to a fermentable liquor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>A distiller may at pleasure convert his whiskey into
gin. He needs only to perfume the wort which he puts
in fermentation, by adding a certain quantity of the
berries, slightly broken: the fermentation is then common
to both; their sweet mucosity enriches that of the
wort, and increases the spirit, while at the same time
the soapy extract, which is the proximate principle of
vegetation, yields the essential oil, which perfumes the
liquor.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[c]</a></p>

<p>The fermentation being common to both substances,
unites them intimately; and when, by the distillation,
the spirit is separated from the water, there remains an
homogenous liquor, resulting from a single creation,
and having that unity of taste, and all the properties of
Holland gin, because obtained by the same means.</p>

<p>One single and same distillation can therefore yield
to the distiller either gin or whiskey, as it requires no
more labor, and its conversion into gin costs only the
price of the berries, which repays him amply, either by
the spirit it yields, or by its essential oil, which, floating
on the surface, may be easily collected. This oil
bears a great price, and the Hollanders sell much of it.</p>

<p>We have seen, in the 10th chapter of this work, that
my hogsheads for the fermentation, contain about 120
gallons of wort, being the production of the saccharine
extract of 12 bushels of grain. The intelligent distiller
will himself determine the quantity of berries necessary
for each hogshead to have a good aromatic per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>fume.
He may begin with 10 lbs. per hogshead; and
will, upon trial, judge whether or not this quantity is
sufficient, or must be increased. At any rate, economy
should not be consulted in the use of the berries, since
their price does not increase that of the whiskey. This
low price must naturally become the principle of an
immense fabrication of gin; and henceforth it will be
an important article of exportation for the United
States, as well as a considerable and wholesome object
of home consumption.</p>

far from Lavoisier's proportions. Others add successively new molasses to

This is absolutely contrary to the true principles of distillation.</p></div>
